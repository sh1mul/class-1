	<h1>Shakhawat Hossain</h1>
	<p>I am Shakhawat Hossain. My friend circle and family members call me my nickname Shimul. It was given by myself when I was a teen. Because it's easier to pronounce than the original name.</p>

<p>I like to try to make things easier for its users and myself. I am a simple person. I love thinking out of the box. I like reading books, blogs, watching movies, and playing music in my leisure</p>
